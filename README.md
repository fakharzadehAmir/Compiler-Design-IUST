# Compiler Design Course Project

## Overview
This repository encompasses my work, assignments, and the main project developed during my Compiler Design course. Implemented with ANTLR and Python, it demonstrates a practical application of compiler construction techniques ranging from lexical analysis to syntax parsing.

## Features
- **Lexer and Parser**: Developed using ANTLR to handle grammatical analysis.
- **Syntax Tree Generation**: Utilizes ANTLR and Python to construct and manipulate syntax trees.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Implements type checking and scope resolution.
- **Code Optimization**: Basic optimization techniques applied to the intermediate code.
